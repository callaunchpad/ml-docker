# ml-docker
A machine learning environment in docker (requires nvidia-docker)

Use `aws.sh` to install CUDA, nvidia-docker and all other necessary dependencies for AWS (tested on a P2.8xlarge with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS AMI).

This Dockerfile contains many small and easy to install frameworks and programs as well as some more painful ones including tensorflow (with gpu support) and opencv.
